<SPEAKER>ROSS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From Fife, great king;</LINE>
<LINE>Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky</LINE>
<LINE>And fan our people cold. Norway himself,</LINE>
<LINE>With terrible numbers,</LINE>
<LINE>Assisted by that most disloyal traitor</LINE>
<LINE>The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;</LINE>
<LINE>Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,</LINE>
<LINE>Confronted him with self-comparisons,</LINE>
<LINE>Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.</LINE>
<LINE>Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,</LINE>
<LINE>The victory fell on us.</LINE>
